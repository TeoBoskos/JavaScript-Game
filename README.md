# Practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript By Making A Game

In this project, I wanted to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills my making a game.

# What does it have

In this game, you fight tank battles in the Eastern Front of WW2 to get money. With the money
that you get, you can obtain better tanks.

# PS

It also included images, but it won't let me upload them.

I don't know how bad this game seems, but the whole point was just to primarily practice my
JavaScript skills, not make a game.

Know that I am open to any kind of criticism that it going to help me improve my skills.
